# Instagram Reels Profile Grid

### Overview

The goal of this test is to replicate the functionality demonstrated in the provided screen recording (derived from Instagram profile reels). You will build this functionality using **SwiftUI** combined with **UIKit** via UIViewRepresentable. The app will use 13 sample videos stored locally.

### Walkthrough Video

### Functionality Requirements

1. **Fullscreen Expansion & Playback:**  
   - Tapping a video from the grid expands the selected view to fullscreen and automatically starts playback.

2. **Dismissal Gesture:**  
   - Allow dragging from the left on the expanded fullscreen view to initiate dismissal.

3. **TabView-like Scrolling & Background Effect:**  
   - Implement scrolling similar to a TabView within the expanded view.
   - The card in the background grid corresponding to the currently focused video should dim (go black).

4. **Snap-to-Card Dismissal:**  
   - When the expanded view is dismissed by dragging and releasing, it should smoothly snap back to its exact position in the grid.

5. **Grid Auto-scroll:**  
   - If the associated card in the grid isn't currently visible (e.g., offscreen at the bottom), automatically scroll the grid to bring it into view upon dismissal.
